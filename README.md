## Abstract

The News is an app where a user can scroll through some news articles. See previews of the top stories of the day that the user can click on to go to a page with more details, or stay on the home page and search for any articles they'd like to read.

## Context

My Take Home simulation project at Turing, which took ~8 hours to complete.

## Wins
- Taking a little more time than usual to plan helped to get through the bulk of the actual coding very quickly.
- Planned the design based around the idea of responsiveness, which made doing it later very easy.
- Quick and easy implementation of a third party API.

## Challenges & Improvements
- Formatting the returned date of the articles was weird and ended up doing it very manually.
- I enjoy CSS & styling but to meet MVP in a limited timeframe I had to set it mostly aside and prioritize functionality.
- Would make the header an actual component and utilize more conditional rendering.

## Set Up
1. Clone the repo to your local machine
1. Run `npm i`, then `npm start`
1. The project should open in the default browser at localhost:3000
